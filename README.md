# FreeCAD AliasManager
Macro developed for FreeCAD (http://www.freecadweb.org/).

This macro helps managing aliases inside FreeCAD Spreadsheet workbench. It is able to:

- create aliases based on first column (A column)

- delete aliases placed on a column

- move aliases from one column to other one

- create a "part family", that's it, create different files for each column in a range. It will add to the original name a suffix based on first row (1)
